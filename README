This is a Facebook Application you can use to subscribe to an iCalendar file which then gets regularly checked for updates. When new events in the calendar become available, it will create a facebook event in your name.

The app page will be online at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Calendar-to-Events-Importer-Community/536493229767772 .

For any questions, please contact Jamma Tino Schwarze over Facebook.

Many thanks to Mauro Bieg who created this app initially!

The original app may be found here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Calendar-to-Event/158110800961417
but will probably stop working in the future because of pending changes to the Facebook API.
