UPDATE: Facebook dropped all event modification APIs with Graph API 2.0 and did not reintroduce them. Take a look here for the current state: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/event/#Creating

This was a Facebook Application you could use to subscribe to an iCalendar file which then gets regularly checked for updates. When new events in the calendar became available, it created a facebook event in your name.

Many thanks to Mauro Bieg who created this app initially!
